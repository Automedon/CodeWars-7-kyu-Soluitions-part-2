/*
An array is given with palindromic and non-palindromic numbers. A palindromic number is a number that is the same from a reversed order. For example 122 is not a palindromic number, but 202 is one.

Your task is to write a function that returns an array with only 1s and 0s, where all palindromic numbers are replaced with a 1 and all non-palindromic numbers are replaced with a 0.

For example:

[101, 2, 85, 33, 14014]  ==>  [1, 1, 0, 1, 0]
[45, 21, 303, 56]        ==>  [0, 0, 1, 0]
*/
function convertPalindromes(numbers) {
  return numbers.map(v=>v===[...v.toString()].reverse().join``*1?1:0)
};
