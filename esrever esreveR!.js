/*
Description:
In this kata you must take an input string, reverse the order of the words, and reverse the order of the letters within the words.

But, as a bonus, every test input will end with a punctuation mark (! ? .) and the output should be returned with the mark at the end.

A few examples should help clarify:

esrever("hello world.") == "dlrow olleh."

esrever("Much l33t?") == "t33l hcuM?"

esrever("tacocat!") == "tacocat!"
Quick Note: A string will always be passed in (though it may be empty) so no need for error-checking other types.
*/
function esrever( str ){
  let last = str.slice(-1);
  let body = str.slice(0,-1).split('').reverse().join``;
  return body+last
}
