Description:
Oh no!
We made a log in system on Codewars but people have been putting random passwords to log in!
Your goal for this kata:
You must make sure all the passwords are valid, there will be two functions: signIn() and logIn(). signIn() will make a new password. logIn() will make sure that the password given is valid.
Example:
// Let us say that someone signed in to codewars and their password is "cracker".
// NOTE: The password will ONLY be a string.
signIn("cracker");

// Now when that someone does logIn("cracker") it should return true.
logIn("cracker");

var logIn = function() {
  // code
  return true;
}

// But if that someone does another password it should return false.
logIn("goat");

var logIn = function() {
  // code
  return false;
}
Have fun!

const passwords=[]
var signIn = function(password) {
 passwords.push(password)
 
};
var logIn = function(password) {
  return !!passwords.find(v=>v===password)
};
