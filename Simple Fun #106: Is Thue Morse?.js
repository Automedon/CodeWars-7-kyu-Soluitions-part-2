/*
Description:
Task
Given a sequence of 0s and 1s, determine if it is a prefix of Thue-Morse sequence.

The infinite Thue-Morse sequence is obtained by first taking a sequence containing a single 0 and then repeatedly concatenating the current sequence with its binary complement.

A binary complement of a sequence X is a sequence Y of the same length such that the sum of elements X_i and Y_i on the same positions is equal to 1 for each i.

Thus the first few iterations to obtain Thue-Morse sequence are:

0
0 1
0 1 1 0
0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1
...
Examples
For seq=[0, 1, 1, 0, 1], the result should be true.

For seq=[0, 1, 0, 0], the result should be false.

Inputs & Output
[input] integer array seq

An non-empty array.

Constraints:

1 <= seq.length <= 1000

seq[i] âˆˆ [0,1]

[output] a boolean value

true if it is a prefix of Thue-Morse sequence. false otherwise.
