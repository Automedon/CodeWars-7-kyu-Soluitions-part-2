Description:
Everyone loved money, but we have a grandma who is not good at math. If the money has commas, it will be easy for her, let us help her.

We should add comma between every 3 numbers

e.g.

money(1234567) // returns '1,234,567'

money(12) // returns '12'
*/
function money(num){
  return num.toLocaleString()
}
