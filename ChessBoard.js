/*
Description:
Write a function that creates a string that represents an 8×8 grid, using newline characters to separate lines. At each position of the grid there is either a space or a “#” character (black='#', black always starts top/left). The characters should form a chess board.


When you have a program that generates this pattern, define a variable size = 8 and change the program so that it works for any size, outputting a grid of the given width and height.
*/
function board(size){
   let chess_row = ""
  for(var y=0;y<size;y++){
    for(var x=0;x<size;x++ ){
      if((y+x)%2 == 0){
        chess_row += '#';
      }else{
        chess_row += ' ';
      }   
    }
    chess_row +="\n";
  }
  return chess_row
