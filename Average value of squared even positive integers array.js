/*
Description:
You should return the average number of the square of all even positive integers (not fractions) in the given array, rounded to the nearest integer.

e.g. for arr = [4, 5.6, -9.8, 3.14, 42, 6, 8.34] it would be [4, 42, 6], which squared is [16, 1764, 36], whose average value is 605.33, which rounded becomes 605 .

If there are no even positive integers in the array, the final result should be 0.
