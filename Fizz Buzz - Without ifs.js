/*
I know that there are quite a few fizz-buzz problems already out there but this one does have a twist (you may find this useful)

Task
You need to implement a function that applies the standard fizz buzz test:

If a number is divisible by 3, return Fizz
If it is divisible by 5, return Buzz
If it is divisible by both 3 and 5, return FizzBuzz
If it is not divisible by 3 or 5, return the number itself
However, when making the function, you cannot use if (meaning else is also not an option).

Input
A number will always be provided
The number provided will always be positive and an integer
Examples
6 should return Fizz
10 should return Buzz
15 should return FizzBuzz
17 should return 17
*/
const fizzBuzz = n => {
  return n%3===0&&n%5===0?"FizzBuzz":n%3===0?"Fizz":n%5===0?"Buzz":n
};
