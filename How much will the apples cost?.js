/*
Buying in bulk is often cheaper than buying individual items. You will have to determine the total cost of apples. Write a function called apples that takes the arguments kilos and price. Purchases of 1 or more kilograms get a discount of 5%, purchases of 3 or more kilograms get a discount of 10%, purchases of 5 or more kilograms get a discount of 15%, and so on until you reach the maxium discount of 30%.
