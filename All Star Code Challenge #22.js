All Star Code Challenge #22

Create a function called toTime() that takes an integer argument of seconds and converts the value into a string describing how many hours and minutes comprise that many seconds.

Any remaining seconds left over are ignored.

Note:
The string output needs to be in the specific form - "X hour(s) and X minute(s)"

toTime(3600); // => '1 hour(s) and 0 minute(s)'
toTime(3601); // => '1 hour(s) and 0 minute(s)'
toTime(3500); // => '0 hour(s) and 58 minute(s)'
toTime(323500); // => '89 hour(s) and 51 minute(s)'
*/
function toTime(seconds) {
  let h = 0;
  while(seconds>=3600){
    h+=1;
    seconds-=3600;
  }
  let sec = Math.trunc(seconds/60)
  return `${h} hour(s) and ${sec} minute(s)`
}
