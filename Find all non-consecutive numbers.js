/*
Description:
Your task is to find all the elements of an array that are not consecutive.

Create a function named allNonConsecutive

E.g., if we have an array [1,2,3,4,6,7,8,10] then 6 and 10 are non-consecutive.

You should return the results as an array of objects with two values i: <the index of the non-consecutive number> and n: <the non-consecutive number>.

E.g., for the above array the result should be:

[
  {i: 4, n:6},
  {i: 7, n:10}
]
If the whole array is consecutive, then return an empty array.

The array will always have at least 2 elements and all the elements will be numbers. The numbers will also all be unique and in ascending order. The numbers could be positive and/or negetive.

function allNonConsecutive (arr) {
   let arr1 = [];
   for (let i=0;i<arr.length-1;i++)
   {
    if (arr[i+1]-1!==arr[i]) arr1.push({i:i+1,n:arr[i+1]})
   }
   return arr1
}
