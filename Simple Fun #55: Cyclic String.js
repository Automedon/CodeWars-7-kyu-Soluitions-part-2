/*
Description:
Task
You're given a substring s of some cyclic string. What's the length of the smallest possible string that can be concatenated to itself many times to obtain this cyclic string?

Example
Fors = "cabca", the output should be 3

"cabca" is a substring of a cycle string "abcabcabcabc..." that can be obtained by concatenating "abc" to itself. Thus, the answer is 3.

Input/Output
[input] string s

Constraints: 3 ≤ s.length ≤ 15.

[output] an integer

  var i=1;
