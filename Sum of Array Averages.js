Description:
Program a function sumAverage(arr) where arr is an array containing arrays full of numbers, for example:

sumAverage([[1, 2, 2, 1], [2, 2, 2, 1]]);
First, determine the average of each array. Then, return the sum of all the averages.

All numbers will be less than 100.
arr will contain a maximum of 50 arrays.
After calculating all the averages, add them all together, then round down, as shown in the example below:
The example given: sumAverage([[3, 4, 1, 3, 5, 1, 4], [21, 54, 33, 21, 77]]), the answer being 44.

Calculate the average of each individual array:
[3, 4, 1, 3, 5, 1, 4] = (3 + 4 + 1 + 3 + 5 + 1 + 4) / 7 = 3
[21, 54, 33, 21, 77] = (21 + 54 + 33 + 21 + 77) / 5 = 41.2
Add the average of each array together:
3 + 41.2 = 44.2
Round the final average down:
Math.floor(44.2) = 44
*/
const sumAverage = (arr) => {
  return Math.floor(arr.map(v=>v.reduce((a,b)=>a+b,0)/v.length).reduce((a,b)=>a+b,0));
}
