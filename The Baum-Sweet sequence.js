Description:
Wikipedia: The Baum–Sweet sequence is an infinite automatic sequence of 0s and 1s defined by the rule:

bn = 1 if the binary representation of n contains no block of consecutive 0s of odd length;
bn = 0 otherwise;

for n ≥ 0.

Define a generator function baumSweet that sequentially generates the values of this sequence.

It will be tested for up to 1 000 000 values.

Note that the binary representation of 0 used here is not 0 but the empty string ( which does not contain any blocks of consecutive 0s ).
