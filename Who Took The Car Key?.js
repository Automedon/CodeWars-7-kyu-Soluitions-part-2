Description:
You woke up from a massive headache and can't seem to find your car key. You find a note with a clue that says:

*"If you're reading this then I have left the state and am well on my way to freedom. Just to make things interesting, I have also provided something for you to track me with. Let the chase begin..."*

Given an array of binary numbers, figure out and return the culprit's message to find out who took the missing car key.

  return message.map(v=>String.fromCharCode(parseInt(v,2))).join('')
