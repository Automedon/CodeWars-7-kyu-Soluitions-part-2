/*
Description:
Create a function that converts British Pounds (GBP) to Swiss Franks (CHF) . The input is the amount of GBP as an integer, and the output should be a string that states the amount of Franks followed by 'Swiss Franks'

For Example:

gbpchf(10) // => '13.10 Swiss Franks' gbpchf(256) // => '335.36 Swiss Franks' The conversion rate you should use is 1.31 CHF for every 1 GBP. All numbers shold be reounded to the nearest hundreth (e.g. 13.00 NOT 13.0 or 13)
*/
function gbpchf(gbp) {
    return `${(gbp*1.31).toFixed(2)} Swiss Franks`
}
