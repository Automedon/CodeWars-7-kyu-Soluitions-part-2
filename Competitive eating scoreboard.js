Description:
You are the judge at a competitive eating competition and you need to choose a winner!

There are three foods at the competition and each type of food is worth a different amount of points. Points are as follows:

Chickenwings: 5 points

Hamburgers: 3 points

Hotdogs: 2 points

Write a function that helps you create a scoreboard. It takes as a parameter a list of objects representing the participants, for example:

[
  {name: "Habanero Hillary", chickenwings: 5 , hamburgers: 17, hotdogs: 11},
  {name: "Big Bob" , chickenwings: 20, hamburgers: 4, hotdogs: 11}
]
It should return "name" and "score" properties sorted by score; if scores are equals, sort alphabetically by name.

[
  {name: "Big Bob", score: 134},
  {name: "Habanero Hillary", score: 98}
]
Happy judging!

  }
  return arr.sort((a,b)=>a.score===b.score?(a.name).localeCompare(b.name):b.score-a.score)
