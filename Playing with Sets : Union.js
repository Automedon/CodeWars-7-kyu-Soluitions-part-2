Description:
Set objects are new JavaScript built-in objects defined since ECMAScript 2015

A Set lets you store unique values of any type. It comes with some useful methods like .add, .clear, .has . . . BUT some "Set operations" are missing, like . . .

Union

Two sets can be "added" together. The union of A and B, denoted by A âˆª B, is the set of all things that are members of either A or B.

Examples:
  {1, 2} âˆª {1, 2} = {1, 2}.
  {1, 2} âˆª {2, 3} = {1, 2, 3}.
  {1, 2, 3} âˆª {3, 4, 5} = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
Task
Create function union getting 2 sets as arguments and returning a new Set as result of union of these 2 sets.

Examples:
A = new Set([1,2]);
B = new Set([2,3]);

C = union(A,B) // -> {1,2,3}

function union(s1, s2){
  let arr =[];
  s1.forEach(v=>arr.push(v))
  s2.forEach(v=>arr.push(v))
  arr=[...new Set(arr)]
  let set= new Set();
  arr.map(v=>set.add(v))
  return set
}
