Description:
Task
Consider the following algorithm for constructing 26 strings S(1) .. S(26):

S(1) = "a";
For i in [2, 3, ..., 26]:
S(i) = S(i - 1) + character(i) + S(i - 1).```

 For example:
S(1) = "a" S(2) = S(1) + "b" + S(1) = "a" + "b" + "a" = "aba" S(3) = S(2) + "c" + S(2) = "aba" + "c" +"aba" = "abacaba" ... S(26) = S(25) + "z" + S(25)``` Finally, we got a long string S(26). Your task is to find the kth symbol (indexing from 1) in the string S(26). All strings consist of lowercase letters only.

Input / Output
[input] integer k

1 â‰¤ k < 226

[output] a string(char in C#)

the kth symbol of S(26)
*/
function abacaba(k) {
  return String.fromCharCode((k^(k-1)).toString(2).length+96)
}
