Description:
Task
Given an array of 2k integers (for some integer k), perform the following operations until the array contains only one element:

On the 1st, 3rd, 5th, etc. 
iterations (1-based) replace each pair of consecutive elements with their sum;
On the 2nd, 4th, 6th, etc. 
iterations replace each pair of consecutive elements with their product.
After the algorithm has finished, there will be a single element left in the array. Return that element.

Example
For inputArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8], the output should be 186.

We have [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] -> [3, 7, 11, 15] -> [21, 165] -> [186], so the answer is 186.

Input/Output
[input] integer array arr

Constraints: 21 ≤ arr.length ≤ 25, -9 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 99.

[output] an integer

      if (i%2!==0) arr=arr.map((v,i)=>v*arr[i+1]).filter((v,i)=>i%2===0)
      if (arr.length===1) return arr[0]
