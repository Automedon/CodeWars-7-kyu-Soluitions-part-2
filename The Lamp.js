/*
Description:
Define a class called Lamp. It will have attributes for color and state. Both attributes will be strings. Color will refer to the color of the lamp and state will be the string "on" if the lamp is on and "off" if the lamp is off. You'll need a way to construct a new instance of the class as well as ways to get and set the two attributes it has.
