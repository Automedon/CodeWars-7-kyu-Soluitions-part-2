Description:
United State of React
Some say The United States has never been so divided. This Kata is a chance for you to unite a once great nation and MAKE AMERICA CODE AGAIN!

What's Involved
State
Changing State
Conditional Rendering based on state
The challenge
You will be given a component called States. You will need to establish an initial state for the component called united and for it to be set to false.

Then write a unite function that changes this state to true.

Then conditionally render a bespoke message in the component.

If the States are united then display "Code for everyone"

If the States aren't united then display "Make America code again"

const React = require('react');

class States extends React.Component {
  constructor() {
    super(); 
    this.state={
    united:false
    }
    this.unite=this.unite.bind(this)
  }
  unite(){
  this.setState({united:!this.state.united})
  }
  render() {
    return <div className="status">{!this.state.united?"Make America code again":"Code for everyone"}</div>
  } 
}
