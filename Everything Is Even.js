Description:
Here at Conformity Inc. we only like even things. We need you to put a stop to anything that does not conform to our strict even only policy.

Write a function that will convert any number to its nearest even number. When the number is halfway between two even numbers it should round away from zero.

Examples

1 => 2

0.5 => 0

-1 => -2

-0.5 => 0
