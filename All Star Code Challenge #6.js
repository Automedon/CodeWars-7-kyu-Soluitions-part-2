All Star Code Challenge #6

After watching the movie "Arrival", your friend Hannah is obsessed with palindrome names. She wants a quick way to check if anyone she knows has one of these unique names.

Create a function, called isPalindrome, that checks if a string is the same backwards as forwards, returning true or false accordingly.

If a non-string value is given as an argument, the function should throw an error.

isPalindrome("hannah") // => true
isPalindrome("billy") // => false 
isPalindrome(1) // => Error
*/
function isPalindrome(str){
  if (typeof str === 'string') return str==[...str].reverse().join``
  throw new Error()
}
