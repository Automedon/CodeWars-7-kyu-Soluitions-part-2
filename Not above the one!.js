Description:
Write an algorithm to remove all the numbers above 1 from the given array.

Just in case we want to make any changes, create an array of the indexes of the removed numbers.

Return a nested array:

the first array being only the 1's and 0's
the second array being the index of the removed numbers
[0,1,2,1,5,6,2,1,1,0]
should return

[[ 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0 ], [ 2, 4, 5, 6 ]]
