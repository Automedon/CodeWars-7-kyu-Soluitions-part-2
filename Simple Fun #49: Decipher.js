/*
Description:
Task
Consider the following ciphering algorithm:

For each character replace it with its code.
Concatenate all of the obtained numbers.
Given a ciphered string, return the initial one if it is known that it consists only of lowercase letters.

Note: here the character's code means its decimal ASCII code, the numerical representation of a character used by most modern programming languages.

Example
For cipher = "10197115121", the output should be "easy".

Explanation:

 charCode('e') = 101, 
 charCode('a') = 97, 
 charCode('s') = 115 
 charCode('y') = 121.
Input/Output
[input] string cipher

A non-empty string which is guaranteed to be a cipher for some other string of lowercase letters.

[output] a string
