/*
This is what the outputs should be based on the inputs
inputs        outputs
[0,1]   ->    [0,1]
[1,4,6] ->    [0,1,2,3,4,5,6]
[3,4,5] ->    [0,1,2,3,4,5]
if the numbers in the array provided are not in order you should order them, but if a value repeats, then you must return an array with only one item, and the value of that item must be 0. like this

inputs        outputs
[2,1]     ->  [0,1,2]
[1,4,4,6] ->  [0]
Notes: all numbers are positive integers.
