/*
Description:
Imagine a book author has hired us to create a function that takes his book as a string as input and finds all instances of a letter that we will call 'x' (case-sensitive) and turns all the letters after 'x' into a capital letter.

For example.

makeEveryLetterAfterXCaps('and larry walked into the park late to chase a squirrel', 'l')

Should return:

"and lArry walKed into the park lAte to chase a squirrel"

If the letter after x is already in caps it should stay in caps.
*/
var makeEveryLetterAfterXCaps = function (str, letter) {
  return str.replace(new RegExp(`${letter}\.`,'g'),v=>v.split``[0]+v.split``[1].toUpperCase())
}
