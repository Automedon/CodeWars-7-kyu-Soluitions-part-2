Description:
You're a junior dev fresh out of a three-month web development bootcamp. You've just taken on a lucrative contract from a trendy startup. You'll get paid more money than you'd ever thought you'd have. It's somewhat unclear what product or service this startup even sells, and their API documentation might as well have been written in Brainfuck, but you'd better learn fast, or you won't finish before the deadline and get paid.

Your assignment today is to write a function in JavaScript. It seems simple enough, but the CEO insists that all developers who work at his company only use the absolute cutting-edge of technology. You must use only the newest of features and frameworks. But such new software tends to be rife with bugs...

Create a function that won't throw an error no matter how new it is.
