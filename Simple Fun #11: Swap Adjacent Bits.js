/*
Description:
Task
You're given an arbitrary 32-bit integer n. Swap each pair of adjacent bits in its binary representation and return the result as a decimal number.

Example
For n = 13, the output should be 14

1310 = 11012 ~> 11102 = 1410

For n = 74, the output should be 133

7410 = 010010102 ~> 100001012 = 13310

Note

the preceding zero written in front of the initial number: since both numbers are 32-bit integers, they have 32 bits in their binary representation. The preceding zeros in other cases don't matter, so they are omitted. Here, however, it does make a difference.

Input/Output
[input] integer n

0 â‰¤ n < 2^30.

[output] an integer
