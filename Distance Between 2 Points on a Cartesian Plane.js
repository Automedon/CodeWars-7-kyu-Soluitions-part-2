/*
Description:
Construct a function 'coordinates', that will return the distance between two points on a cartesian plane, given the x and y coordinates of each point.

There are two parameters in the function, p1 and p2. p1 is a list [x1,y1] where x1 and y1 are the x and y coordinates of the first point. p2 is a list [x2,y2] where x2 and y2 are the x and y coordinates of the second point.

The distance between the two points should be rounded to the precision decimal if provided, otherwise to the nearest integer.
*/
function coordinates([x1,y1],[x2,y2], precision){
  return precision?Math.hypot((x1-x2),(y1-y2)).toFixed(precision)*1:Math.hypot((x1-x2),(y1-y2)).toFixed(0)*1
}
