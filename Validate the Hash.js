/*
Description:
A file's hash value is essentially a string of numbers and letters of fixed length, that functions as a cryptographic fingerprint for that file.

File hashes are commonly used in cyber security to identify different strains of malware, with a unique hash value corresponding to each malware file.

Your junior analyst has just sent you a list of new malware hashes, but you know he has made mistakes entering them. Write a function to validate the array of hash values.

In this scenario, a valid hash value consists of five numbers and five lowercase letters in any order.

Return an array of valid hash values, and eliminate any duplicates.
