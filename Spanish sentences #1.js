/*
Description:
In Spanish, sentences not only end with exclamation and question marks, but also begin with them (actually flipped over version).

It looks like:

¿Cómo estás?      -> How are you?
¡Es maravilloso!  -> It is wonderful!
Keeping in mind only the above-mentioned fact, your task is to find out how many sentences in unput array are "spanish" and return '¡n spanish sentence(s) here and hasta la vista, baby!'

For example:

spanishSent(['How are you?', '¿How are you?',  'It is you', '¡It is you', '¡You are hot!'])  -> '¡2 spanish sentences here and hasta la vista, baby!'

spanishSent(['¿How are you', '¿How are you?', '!It is me', 'You are.'])  -> '¡1 spanish sentence here and hasta la vista, baby!'
P.S. Array's length > 0.
*/
function spanishSent(arr) {
  let count = 0;
  arr.map(v=>{
  if (v[0]==='¿'&&v[v.length-1]==='?') count++
  if (v[0]==='¡'&&v[v.length-1]==='!') count++
  })
  return `¡${count} spanish sentence${count===1?'':'s'} here and hasta la vista, baby!`
}
