Description:
Welcome. Welcome all to my very second Kata. As you know, the first one was a huge success. This time, however, things are going to be a little bit different. Is it going to be as cool as the last one? Let's find out! Tell your friends! ï˜‹

Given an integer b greater than 0, create and return a b X b matrix with the following pattern:

                     [x,1]
matrixSquareUp(2) => [2,1]

                     [x,x,1]
                     [x,2,1]
matrixSquareUp(3) => [3,2,1]

                     [x,x,x,1]
                     [x,x,2,1]
                     [x,3,2,1]
matrixSquareUp(4) => [4,3,2,1]
Those are lowercase 'x'.

50 > b > 0
*/
const matrixSquareUp = b => {
  let arr =[];
  let tempArr=[]
  for (let i=1 ; i<=b;i++){
  tempArr=[];
    for (let j=b ; j>0;j--){
      if (j>i) tempArr.push('x')
      else tempArr.push(j+'')
    }
    arr.push(tempArr)
  }
  return arr
}
