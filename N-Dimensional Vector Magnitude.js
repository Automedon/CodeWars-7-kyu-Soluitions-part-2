/*
Description:
Return the magnitude of a vector, given as an array of its component values.

The vector (2, 3, 5) would be represented as an array containing three values at indices 0, 1 and 2 respectively.
The array will always contain at least 2 and at most 100 elements (2 ≤ vector.Length ≤ 100), each of which will be within the range [-100, 100]. 
An array containing four elements represents a vector in 4D space.

    return Math.sqrt(vector.reduce((a,b)=>a+b*b,0))
