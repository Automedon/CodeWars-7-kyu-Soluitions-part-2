Description:
I guess this is a ?kyu kata. series #1:
Search result

Description
You are using a search engine and type some keywords. For the sake of simplicity, we simplify all the keywords into one letter. For example, "abc" represents three keywords: a, b and c. We have a lot of search results, please pick out the results that contain all the keywords.

Example:

keywords="abc", searchResult=["ab","abc","abcd","bcd"]
You should return: ["abc","abcd"]
Key words can have different order, also may not be continuous and You don't need to sort them out or to remove the same result:

keywords="abc", 
searchResult=["ab","cba","abc","axbxc","ddd","abc","cxab","aabbcc"]
You should return: ["cba","abc","axbxc","abc","cxab","aabbcc"]
Key words may contains uppercase letters:

keywords="Yes", 
searchResult=["yes","Yes","Yeah","Yestoday"]
You should return: ["Yes","Yestoday"]
OK, that's all. I guess this is a 7kyu kata. If you agree, please rank it as 7kyu and vote very;-) If you think this kata is too easy or too hard, please shame me by rank it as you want and vote somewhat or none :[

Task
Complete function finalResult that accepts two arguments keywords and searchResult, return all valid results that contains all keywords.

Argument keywords is always a string that contains uppercase or lowercase letters; Argument searchResult is always a string array that contains any strings.

function finalResult(keywords,searchResult){
  return searchResult.filter(v=>keywords.split``.every(x=>v.split``.includes(x)))
}
