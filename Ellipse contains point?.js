Description:
You are given a length of string and two thumbtacks. On thumbtack goes into the focus point F₀ with coordinates x₀ and y₀, and the other does into point F₁ with points x₁ and y₁. The string is then tied at the ends to the thumbtacks and has length l excluding the knots at the ends. If you pull the string taught with a pencil and draw around the plane you'll have an ellipse with focuses at F₀ and F₁. Given a new point P, determine if it falls inside of the ellipse.

You must write a function ellipseContainsPoint that takes arguments f0, f1, l, and p and returns true or false dpending on whether or not p falls inside the ellipse.

Each of f0, f1, and p has has properties x and y for its coordinates.

You will never be given the case where the string is too short to reach between the points.

let ellipseContainsPoint = (f0, f1, l, p) =>  Math.hypot(p.x - f0.x, p.y - f0.y) + Math.hypot(p.x - f1.x, p.y - f1.y) <= l;
