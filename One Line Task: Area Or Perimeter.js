Description:
It's based on this kata. It's suggested that you solve that kata first.

Task
You are given the length and width of a 4 sided polygon. The polygon can either be a rectangle or a square.

Your job is to check if it is a square then return the area. If it is a rectangle then return its perimeter.

Test.assertEquals(area_or_perimeter(6 , 10) , 32);
Note
Note : For the purposes of Kata you will assume that it is a square when lengths are equal otehrwise it is a rectangle.

Code Limit
code.length < 39 characters.

Advice: if your code length is much longer than the limit, giving up is also a good choice :D
