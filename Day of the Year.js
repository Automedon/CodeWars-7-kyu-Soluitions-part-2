Work out what number day of the year it is.

toDayOfYear([1, 1, 2000]) => 1
The argument passed into the function is an array with the format [M, D, YYYY], e.g. [1, 2, 2000] for February 1st, 2000 or [22, 12, 1999] for December 22nd, 1999.

Don't forget to check for whether it's a leap year! Three criteria must be taken into account to identify leap years:

The year can be evenly divided by 4;
If the year can be evenly divided by 100, it is NOT a leap year, unless;
The year is also evenly divisible by 400. Then it is a leap year.
