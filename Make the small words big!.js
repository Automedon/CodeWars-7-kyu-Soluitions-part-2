Life isn't always easy as a small word amongst big words. If only they had a code warrior to help them out...

Your task is to make all words which are 3 characters or less into capitals. You should also remove any vowels from 'long' (4 characters or more) words.

For example:

"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"

Should become:

"THE qck brwn FOX jmps vr THE lzy DOG"

For the purposes of this kata, mid-word punctuation counts towards the character limit of a word.

e.g: "it's / I'm" should become: "t's / I'M"
