/*
Description:
An email address such as "John.Smith@example.com" is made up of a local part ("John.Smith"), an "@" symbol, then a domain part ("example.com").

The domain name part of an email address may only consist of letters, digits, hyphens and dots. The local part, however, also allows a lot of different special characters.

Given a valid email address, find its domain part.

Examples

For address = "prettyandsimple@example.com", the output should be findEmailDomain(address) = "example.com";

For address = "<>[]:,;@\"!#$%&*+-/=?^_{}| ~.a\"@example.org", the output should be findEmailDomain(address) = "example.org".
*/
function findEmailDomain(address) {
   return address.match(/@{1,1}\w+\.\w+\.?\w+?$/).toString().slice(1)
}
