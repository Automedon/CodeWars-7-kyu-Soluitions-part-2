Description:
Alternating Among Three Values
Suppose a variable x can have only three possible different values a, b and c, and you wish to assign to x the value other than its current one, and you wish your code to be independent of the values of a, b and c.

What is the most efficient way to cycle among three values? Write a function f so that it satisfies

  f(a) = b
  f(b) = c
  f(c) = a
EXAMPLE
  f( 3, { a:3, b:4, c:5 } ) => 4
*/
function f(x, cc) { 
  let arr = Object.values(cc)
  for (let i=0;i<arr.length;i++)
  {
    if (arr[i]===x&&arr[i+1]===0) return 0
    if (arr[i]===x) return arr[i+1]||arr[0]
  }
}
