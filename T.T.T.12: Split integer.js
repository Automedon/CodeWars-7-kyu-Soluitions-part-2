Description:
They say that only the name is long enough to attract attention. They also said that only a simple Kata will have someone to solve it. series #12: Split integer


Task
Given a positive integer n (n>=2), split it into the sum of at least TWO positive integers and maximize the product of those integers. Return the maximum product you can get.

For example:

if ```n = 2```, should return ```1``` (2 = 1 + 1, 1 x 1 = 1); 

If ```n = 10```, should return ```36``` (10 = 3 + 3 + 4, 3 x 3 x 4 = 36).
*/
function splitInt(n) {
  if(n==2) return 1;
  if(n==3) return 2;
  let dp=Array(200).fill(0);
  dp[2]=2;
  dp[3]=3;
  for(let i=4;i<=n;i++){
    for(let j=2;j<i;j++){
      let t=dp[j]*dp[i-j];
      if(t>dp[i])
        dp[i]=t;
      }
    }
  return dp[n];
}
