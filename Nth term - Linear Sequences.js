/*
Description:
Task
Given an array of numbers, work out the Nth term of the sequence and return it as a String in the form an + b.

Input
All arrays provided will consist of 5 elements
Every array will be a sequence
All sequences provided will be linear
All sequences will start with the first element being n = 1
Examples
[1, 3, 5, 7, 9] should return 2n + -1
[1, 5, 9, 13, 17] should return 4n + -3
[11, 16, 21, 26, 31] should return 5n + 6
Note
When returning the answer, ensure that it is in the form an + b - if b is negative then it should be an + -b and not an - b.
