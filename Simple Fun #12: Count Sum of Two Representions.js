Description:
Task
Given integers n, l and r, find the number of ways to represent n as a sum of two integers A and B such that l ≤ A ≤ B ≤ r.

Example
For n = 6, l = 2 and r = 4, the output should be 2

There are just two ways to write 6 as A + B, where 2 ≤ A ≤ B ≤ 4:

6 = 2 + 4 and 6 = 3 + 3

Input/Output
[input] integer n

A positive integer.

Constraints: 5 ≤ n ≤ 106.

[input] integer l

A positive integer.

Constraints: 1 ≤ l ≤ r.

[input] integer r

A positive integer.

Constraints: l ≤ r ≤ 106

[output] an integer
