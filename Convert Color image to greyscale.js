/*
Description:
An array of size N x M represents pixels of an image. Each cell of this array contains an array of size 3 with the pixel's color information: [R,G,B]

Convert the color image, into an average greyscale image.

The [R,G,B] array contains integers between 0 and 255 for each color.

To transform a color pixel into a greyscale pixel, average the values of that pixel:

p = [R,G,B] => [(R+G+B)/3, (R+G+B)/3, (R+G+B)/3]
Note: the values for the pixel must be integers, therefore you should round floats to the nearest integer.

Example
Here's an example of a 2x2 image:

[
 [ [123, 231, 12], [56, 43, 124] ],
 [ [78, 152, 76], [64, 132, 200] ]
]
Here's the expected image after transformation:

[
 [ [122, 122, 122], [74, 74, 74] ],
 [ [102, 102, 102], [132, 132, 132] ]
]
*/
var color2grey = function (image) {
  return image.map(a => a.map(b => b.map(c => Math.round(b.reduce((m, n) => m + n, 0)/3))));
};
