Description:
Task
The longest diagonals of a square matrix are defined as follows:

the first longest diagonal goes from the top left corner to the bottom right one;
the second longest diagonal goes from the top right corner to the bottom left one.```
Given a square `matrix`, your task is to swap its longest diagonals by exchanging their elements at the corresponding positions.

# Example

 For
matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]the output should be [[3, 2, 1], [4, 5, 6], [9, 8, 7]]```

Input/Output
[input] 2D integer array matrix

Constraints: 1 ≤ matrix.length ≤ 10, matrix.length = matrix[i].length, 1 ≤ matrix[i][j] ≤ 1000.

[output] 2D integer array

Matrix with swapped diagonals.
