Description:
The card game Lost Cities contains two types of cards: Numbered cards and wagers cards. To calculate oneâ€™s score, a player totals all the number cards they played and any wager cards played are used as score multipliers.

1 wager card = score * 2
2 wager cards = score * 3
3 wager cards = score * 4
Additionally, if the player plays any cards at all (numbered or wager), there is a one-time 20 point penalty, meaning the player's score begins at -20. Wager points should be multiplied after all other calculations.

Write a function where, given an array of numbers (the numbered cards played) and a second parameter (# of wager cards played), will calculate a playerâ€™s score.

Note: If both parameters into the function are empty, this means no cards were played.

Example:

calculateScore([2, 4, 6, 7, 8], 2);
// Expected output: 21
*/
function calculateScore(cardsArr, wager) {
   return cardsArr.length === 0 && wager === 0 ? 0 : cardsArr.reduce((a,b) => a+b, -20) * (wager+1);
}
