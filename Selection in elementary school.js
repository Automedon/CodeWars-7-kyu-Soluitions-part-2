Description:
Hello, my name is Anna, and I'm the director of elementary school. Every month I accept applications for schooling from new guys and when I process it manually, I get a little tired. Ð¡ould you help me and automate this process?

If so, you have information about the ages of all these new pupils (array of ages - only positive digital numbers). Your goal is to sort sort these ages by grade. Your function schoolSelection needs to return an object where key is grade level and value is a number of convenient ages.

Additional information:

Level           -> age

Kindergarten     -> 5
1st grade        -> 6
2nd grade        -> 7
3rd grade        -> 8
4th grade        -> 9
Example:

schoolSelection([5, 7, 4, 9, 10, 5, 15, 9, 5])

Output: 
{
  'Kindergarten': 3,
  '1st grade': 0,
  '2nd grade': 1, 
  '3rd grade': 0, 
  '4th grade': 2,
}
*/
function schoolSelection(array) {
  let Kindergarten = 0;
  let st_grade1    = 0;
  let st_grade2    = 0;
  let st_grade3    = 0;
  let st_grade4    = 0;
  for (let i=0;i<array.length;i++){
    if (array[i]===5) Kindergarten++
    if (array[i]===6) st_grade1++
    if (array[i]===7) st_grade2++
    if (array[i]===8) st_grade3++
    if (array[i]===9) st_grade4++
  }
  return {Kindergarten,'1st grade':st_grade1,'2nd grade':st_grade2,'3rd grade':st_grade3,'4th grade':st_grade4}
}
